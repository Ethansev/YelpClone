# YelpClone
 Web application that demonstrates CRUD functionality to manipulate dynamic data via MongoDB, implementation of user authentication, and full-stack deployment via AWS Mongo Atlas & Heroku. Users can register, login, add new campgrounds, edit their existing campgrounds, leave reviews, and delete their own data.

Sidenote: This project is officially deployed! I still need to seed new data because we setup a completely new database in the cloud, but I want to make some edits to the schemas for additional features.
