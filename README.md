# YelpClone
 Web application that demonstrates CRUD functionality to manipulate dynamic data via MongoDB, implementation of user authentication, and full-stack deployment via AWS Mongo Atlas & Heroku. Users can register, login, add new campgrounds, edit their existing campgrounds, leave reviews, and delete their own data. 

## Live Demo (coming soon)

### Technologies Used
**Front-end**:  Bootstrap, ejs\
**Back-end**:  Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, NPM\
**Deployment**:  AWS Mongo Atlas, Heroku

### Future Plans
- [ ] Search funcionality
- [ ] UI redesign (polish)
- [ ] Review ratings and images
- [ ] Include information on National Parks (NPS provides their own API!)
- [ ] Dark theme (because I can)

### Other Resources

Sidenote: 
: The database is currently being hosted locally, but I will move it to the cloud via AWS during deployment.
